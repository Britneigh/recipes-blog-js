            were in Germany. Let's go ahead with our first meal:

            <h3>1. Currywurst</h3>
            <img src="Images\Currywurst-mit-Pommes.jpg" alt="Currywurst">
            <p>Currywurst was invented in 1949, 5 years after the end of WWII by a lady called Herta Heuwer. Back then, the dish was actually made by combining ketchup (that
                she got in return by trading spririts to the British soldiers), Worcestershire sauce and curry powder sprinkled on top of grilled sausage! The purpose was to
                combat the low quality food during the Cold War by enhancing its taste. Even now, it is still one of the top most eaten street food in Germany! </p>

                        <li>2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
                        <li>1 1/2 tbsp curry powder</li>

                <h4>Instructions:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <b>The Curry:</b>
                    <li>Add the 1tbsp of vegetable oil in a small saucepan and wait for the oil to heat up. When the oil is ready, lower it to medium heat and cook the diced onions, 
                    don't cook to the point it becomes brown. </li>
                    <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute. </li>
                    <li>Then, follow up with all the other ingredients apart from the Bratwursts and French fries. Cook for a further 30 seconds before leaving it to simmer for 15
                    minutes, stirring occasionally. Add water if it seems a little dry. That's the sauce done. </li>
                    <b>The Wurst:</b>
                    <li>If the Bratwursts are not pre-cooked, simmer it in water first.</li>
                    <li>Next, decide if you want to grill or pan-fry them. (Bratwursts are usually grilled.) Make sure they are cooked until the outer skin is crispy brown!</li>
                    <li>Serve it as a whole or cut up into bite-size pieces with French fries on the side. Don't forget to glaze it with the cooked curry sauce, sprinkled with
                    extra curry powder!</li>

            <h3>2. Schnitzel</h3>
            <img src="Images\Schnitzel.jpg" alt="Schnitzel">
            <p>There are many variations of this dish in other countries but in Germany, the Schnitzels are mainly pork or chicken. Typically boneless meat cutlets. Of course,
                it would not be Schnitzel without the meat being tenderised, completely breaded and then deep-fried. The word Schnitzel comes from the German verb 'schneiden' which
                means 'to cut/slice', in other words, sliced meat. They are also served with french fries or boiled potatoes on the side. For the ingredients below, I'll be using pork.
            </p>
                <div class="preparations">
                    <h4>Total Cook time: 30 mins</h4>
                    <p>Ingredients:</p>
                    <!-- Ingredients list-->
                    <ul>
                        <li>Boneless pork steaks or chops</li>
                        <li>4 tsp salt (or to taste)</li>
                        <li>4 tsp freshly ground black pepper (or to taste)</li>
                        <li>2 cups panko bread crumbs</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                        <li>3 eggs, beaten</li>
                        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
                        <li><i>Boiled potatoes/French fries (Optional)</i></li>
                        <!-- 8 items on the list -->
                    </ul>
                <h4>Instructions:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pour the vegetable oil in a non-stick frying pan on high flame. The bigger the pan, the more Schnitzels you can place in. There should be enough oil for the
                        Schnitzel to swim in it.
                    </li>
                    <li>While waiting for the oil heat up, place the pork steaks between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound them until they are just 1/4 inch thick with the flat 
                        side of a meat tenderizer. Lightly season both sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
                    <li>Put the flour, beaten eggs, and breadcrumbs in 3 separate shallow bowls. Now dip both sides of the pork steaks in the flour first, next the egg, then
                        the panko breadcrumbs, making sure it's coated all around and equally in every stage. Gently shake off the excess crumbs. Fry immediately. They should sizzle 
                        once they're in the pan. If it's browning too quickly, it means the oil is too hot. Reduce and control the heat as needed.</li>
                    <li>Fry until the current side is golden brown before flipping the meat to cook the other side.</li>
                    <li>Finally, take out a plate and line it with paper towels to help soak up the excessive oil before serving the Schnitzel (and a side dish, if you like).</li>

            <h3>3. Spätzle</h3>
            <img src="Images\Spaetzle.jpg" alt="Spätzle">
            <p>This is Germany's renowned egg noodle dish from the Baden-Württemberg region of southwest Germany, also known as <i>Schwabenland</i> or <i>Swabia</i>. It is said that
                the Swabian word "Spätzle" comes from the fact that when the noodles were made by hand or with a spoon, it resembled a sparrow's nest. <i>Spatz</i> meaning sparrow in
                German. What separates this pasta from others is that Spätzle is made fresh during the time of cooking, rather than dried and stored for later. Spätzle is not only
                enjoyed in Germany but also in other Central European countries such as Austria, Switzerland, Hungary, etc. The pasta is generally served on the side with meat
                (for example: Schnitzel) and sauce or added to soups. For this recipe, it'll be a side dish.</p>

                    <p>Ingredients:</p>

                        <li>4 eggs</li>
                        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup milk <i>or</i> water</li>
                        <!-- 4 items on the list -->
                    </ul>
                <h4>Instructions:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a bowl, whisk together the flour, eggs, and salt while pouring milk/water in slowly. The batter should neither be too thin nor too thick or you will
                        struggle with your Spätzle maker later on. Stir until the batter is lump-free and smooth enough that it drips off the spoon slowly. You can also use your
                        electric mixer. </li>
                    <li>Let the batter sit for 5-10 min. Start boiling water over high heat in a large pot. Add salt to the water.</li>
                    <li>Now, spoon portions of the Spätzle batter onto your Spätzle maker/colander and scrape the batter through into the boiling water. The Spätzle will float to the
                        surface once they are done.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the cooked Spätzle onto the colander to let excess water drip off before serving it in a bowl. Add grated cheese over the Spätzle if you want
